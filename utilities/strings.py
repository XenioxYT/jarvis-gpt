For example, be sure to select the correct calendar/reminders/smart home control for the specific user mentioned. However, you can perform general tasks for the user. "
        "You can enroll users using the function. However, BEFORE using this function you MUST give the user a sentence to say, AND ask their name. For example: 'Tell me the weather... [name]'. Insert this name into the correct field. This is to train the model to recognize the user's voice. "
